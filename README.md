Less Simple Watchface
=====================

This is a Pebble watchface for the Pebble smartwatch. It is inspired by
the Simplicity watchface that is available through the Pebble app. I
made a couple modifications to the original design, namely adding
seconds and the day of the week.

I have included the built watchface for easy installation if you want to
check it out.

Installation
------------

To install on your Pebble, simply load this page on your smart phone and
then mash this link with your favorite finger:
[build/less_simple.pbw](https://github.com/tpett/pebble-less-simple/blob/master/build/less_simple.pbw?raw=true).
If asked which app to open the file with select the Pebble app.

Change Log
----------

#### 2.1
Improvements to battery consumption. Only the necessary parts of the
screen are redrawn on each tick rather than blindly redrawing
everything.

#### 2.0
Initial Release (why start at 1.0?)
